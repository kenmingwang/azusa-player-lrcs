[00:08.097]I got love up in my pocket and I don’t know what to do with it,
[00:16.404]I got love up in my rocket and I don’t know what to do with it,
[00:24.981]I got you up in my dreams but I’m all stuck in a reality,
[00:33.414]that you never really felt the same it’s more like you were using me
[00:41.697]I get chills when you leave my body
[00:46.074]I get chills when you leave my body
[00:50.341]I get chills when you’re not inside me
[00:54.557]I get chills when you’re not inside me
[00:59.024]I got love up in my pocket and I don’t know what to do with it,
[01:07.483]I got love up in my rocket and I don’t know what to do with it
[01:15.623]And I’m high as hell
[01:17.751]In the wishing well of
[01:19.885]Your eyes when you would look at me
[01:24.215]There’s no way to say how much time it takes
[01:28.305]To move on, forget, and keep it moving....
[01:36.956]
[01:43.656]Lost my mind and I don’t know just where it went it’s still a mystery,
[01:52.089]Took a trip and saw the sun and swore I thought that s**t was mercury
[02:00.305]Don’t think you understand, all the things that you make me see
[02:08.722]Make me move when I’m down because you’re movin’ inside me
[02:17.256]I get chills when you leave my body
[02:21.750]I get chills when you leave my body
[02:25.817]I get chills when you’re not inside me
[02:30.116]I get chills when you’re not inside me
[02:34.396]Only taking me a second to see if I'm gonna vibe with her
[02:36.714]She said when you gonna finish? I said in like5 minutes
[02:38.747]She's an independent type she never need a guy with her
[02:40.833]Never minding my business, she's my ride or die with it
[02:42.897]Sipping on the Goose right now feeling sad and aroused
[02:45.295]See you taking off your mask when nobody's around, girl...
[02:47.925]You ain’t gotta do that sh*t around me
[02:49.661]I'm a gentleman who spent a lot of time around freaks
[02:51.735]All this fake facade
[02:52.686]Just made some possibilities
[02:54.031]For us to love without no liabilities
[02:56.115]I’m proud to say you came in here to save me
[02:58.452]Had a scope but don't know where I'm aiming
[03:00.480]Do you see the smile up on my motherrf**king face
[03:02.598]I don't care what any other mother**ker say
[03:04.700]Lookin’ around and I don’t see a hand or a help
[03:06.693]So I'm lookin in the mirror saying look at what you made me
[03:08.371]I get chills when you leave my body
[03:12.537]I get chills when you leave my body
[03:16.687]I get chills when you’re not inside me
[03:20.888]I get chills when you’re not inside me
[03:27.471]
