[00:14.68]Dreaming of you when I'm alone
[00:18.30]Baby don't trip I'm coming home
[00:21.92]Kick it with me I don't care if the sun is gone
[00:29.36]Baby don't cry when I am gone
[00:33.08]Promise you are everything I want
[00:36.60]This is for you baby listen it's your song
[00:43.29]Oye cariño, solo pienso en ti
[00:47.23]When I wake up in the morning until I go back to sleep
[00:50.92]How I wish you were mine, I think of you all the time
[00:54.39]I always feel like I'm flying, baby you make me feel fine
[00:58.74]Lost in the words that you say to me
[01:02.19]y pasando tiempo juntos is the ultimate dream
[01:05.88]I'm on the top of the world baby girl can't you see
[01:09.51]I found my perfect girl
[01:11.19]I want to make you my queen
[01:13.30]Time and time again I can be feeling real sad, cos mi sueño no se ha hecho una realidad
[01:20.59]Pero el tiempo dirá, el tiempo dirá
[01:24.02]If we go spend our life together en lo que el mundo gira
[01:28.52]I promise I don't want nobody else to be around me but you and nobody's touch and nobody's lips can make me feel like yours do
[01:35.53]Our hands in a lock, nuestros labios se conocen
[01:39.59]Nuestra noche es corta pero hermosa we'll be okay
[01:43.29]Dreaming of you when i'm alone
[01:46.96]Baby don't trip i'm coming home
[01:50.61]kick it with me i don't care if the sun is gone
[01:57.99]Baby don't cry when I am gone
[02:01.60]promise you are everything i want
[02:05.43]This is for you baby listen, it's your song
[02:12.10]Sin ti mis días son largos y se sienten tan amargos
[02:16.12]me ahogo en un lago de mis lagrimas que hago
[02:19.83]Can't look forward to my future if it ain't including you
[02:23.32]Promise that I'm gonna love you, it's about that time you do
[02:27.16]I swear I don't see nothing better than to lay here with you
[02:30.83]And I hope you know I miss you from my head, I can't dismiss you
[02:34.50]Eres lo que yo anhelaba en esta vida, que me falta
[02:38.07]Lo que siento is surreal
[02:40.03]i can't lie to you for real
[02:42.25]Sabes bien que te quiero and if you're down to spend your summer with me just let me know
[02:57.04]You know you are my sueño, you came to my life and now I feel alright
[03:11.64]Dreaming of you when I'm alone
[03:15.46]Baby don't trip I'm coming home
[03:19.09]Kick it with me I don't care if the sun is gone
[03:26.43]Baby don't cry when I am gone
