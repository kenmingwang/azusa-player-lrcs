[00:00.32]She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[00:02.86]But she fell in love with an English man
[00:05.47]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[00:07.76]Said baby I just wanna dance
[00:09.68]I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
[00:12.28]She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
[00:14.83]She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
[00:16.98]Said it was one of my friend’s songs do you want to drink on?
[00:19.67]She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
[00:21.98]She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shot gun
[00:24.59]Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
[00:26.82]Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know
[00:29.37]She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[00:31.72]But she fell in love with an English man
[00:34.17]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[00:36.61]Said baby I just want to dance
[00:38.54]With my pretty little Galway Girl
[00:41.81]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[00:48.69]You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
[00:51.13]And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
[00:53.38]As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
[00:55.84]After dancing to céili singing to trad tunes
[00:58.19]I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
[01:00.60]Acapella on the bar using her feet for a beat
[01:02.88]Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
[01:05.28]And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me，you know
[01:07.96]She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[01:10.36]But she fell in love with an English man
[01:12.75]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[01:15.09]Said baby I just want to dance
[01:16.99]With my pretty little Galway girl
[01:20.12]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[01:25.09]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[01:30.04]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[01:36.62]Now we’ve outstayed our welcome and it’s closing time
[01:39.10]I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
[01:41.45]Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
[01:43.86]As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
[01:46.26]I walked her home then she took me inside
[01:48.60]Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
[01:51.04]I swear I’m gonna put you in a song that I write
[01:53.28]About a Galway girl and a perfect night
[01:55.86]She played the fiddle in an Irish band
[01:58.21]But she fell in love with an English man
[02:00.61]Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
[02:02.98]Said baby I just want to dance
[02:04.90]With my pretty little Galway girl
[02:08.12]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[02:13.02]My my my my my my my Galway girl
[02:17.84]My my my my my my my Galway girl
