[00:22.16]People keep asking about this glow I seem to have
[00:25.72]'Cause I'm just not the same
[00:29.28]
[00:32.22]They say I'm walking different, talking different
[00:35.34]Looks like all of me has changed
[00:39.39]
[00:41.71]Magic is in my eyes, I can no longer hide
[00:49.81]
[00:51.25]When they look at me
[00:52.50]
[00:53.62]What they fail to see
[00:54.99]
[00:55.99]Is the love you got me feeling
[00:58.43]Like I'm dancing on the ceiling
[01:01.36]I can hardly breathe
[01:02.48]
[01:03.55]'Cause you're all I need
[01:04.92]
[01:05.97]So when they ask me why I'm smiling like a fool
[01:09.29]
[01:10.60]I blame you
[01:11.59]
[01:13.72]Oh, baby, I blame you
[01:16.59]
[01:22.12]My mind is frozen, got me open of you love
[01:25.82]Can't think of no one else
[01:29.37]
[01:32.12]I smell the roses, doing poses in the mirror
[01:35.80]You make me love myself
[01:39.04]
[01:41.85]Magic is in my eyes, I can no longer hide
[01:49.53]
[01:51.41]When they look at me
[01:52.46]
[01:53.65]What they fail to see
[01:54.83]
[01:56.20]Is the love you got me feeling
[01:58.39]Like I'm dancing on the ceiling
[02:01.01]I can hardly breathe
[02:02.38]
[02:03.81]'Cause you're all I need
[02:04.88]
[02:06.07]So when they ask me why I'm smiling like a fool
[02:09.18]
[02:10.68]I blame you
[02:12.50]
[02:13.75]Oh, baby, I blame you
[02:16.85]
[02:20.52]I blame you
[02:21.64]
[02:24.02]Oh, baby, I blame you
[02:26.57]
[02:32.27]I blame you each and every day
[02:34.89]
[02:35.76]It's your fault that I'm completely blown away
[02:39.48]
[02:42.16]You've been building castles in the sky
[02:44.35]
[02:45.03]A place for only you and I
[02:46.84]
[02:47.72]I, I, I
[02:50.15]
[02:51.14]I blame you
[02:51.96]
[02:54.07]Oh, baby, I blame you
[02:56.69]
[03:00.46]I blame you
[03:01.52]
