[00:30.37]It's funny how the music put times in perspective
[00:32.96]Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
[00:35.71]Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
[00:40.51]It's funny how the music put times in perspective
[00:43.80]Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
[00:46.40]Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
[00:51.29]Like a movie that you can't predict
[00:53.19]Like a book that you can't resist
[00:55.70]I sing along a song that's oh so sensual
[00:58.14]bring along a sip to make it all so ***ual
[01:01.18]verbally that is, making love to the music means vibing to the beat at night
[01:05.73]with the whole city fast asleep, out cold
[01:08.21]true words seem to rise to the lips, take hold
[01:10.81]of a poet in me, most powerfully
[01:13.15]I feel free when the world doesn't owe it to me
[01:15.63]It's so hard to find a gig that lives up to the billing,
[01:18.41]trying to find a reason to work, god willing
[01:21.10]I admit, my thinking is wishful
[01:22.93]like a star upon a child gazing up to the ceiling
[01:25.89]how far do we have to stretch the truth
[01:28.24]to fit the lifestyles borrowed and overdue
[01:30.90]we can take it all back to the register
[01:33.32]and start all over from the canister
[01:35.92]Just break it all down into pieces of bright
[01:38.53]moments that pass by like a meteorite
[01:41.11]throw on your favorite reel that's good to go
[01:43.45]on the analog player watch the people glow
[01:45.98]sit back to the breeze let the memories flow
[01:48.53]comedy tragedy all the highs and lows
[01:51.13]It's funny how the music put times in perspective
[01:53.78]Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
[01:56.49]Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
[02:00.83]Wherever you are
[02:22.31]Like your moves that I can't predict
[02:24.54]Like your look that I can't resist
[02:26.65]The ting-a-ling feeling was oh so mutual
[02:29.16]the lingering appeal was so unusual
[02:32.13]herbally what is, medicine to a lone soul can become poison to some
[02:36.58]with the whole city fast asleep, out cold
[02:39.12]true vision seem to come to the eye, take hold
[02:42.16]of a prophet in me most visibly
[02:44.20]I see clear when the world doesn't show it to me
[02:46.47]It's so hard to make sense in a cycle of billing,
[02:49.33]trying to find a reason to quit and make a killing
[02:52.20]I admit, my thinking is wishful
[02:54.20]like a star upon a child staring down from the ceiling
[02:56.89]how far do we have to stretch the picture
[02:59.53]before pixelating the human texture
[03:01.99]we can take it all back to the register
[03:04.38]and start all over from the canister
[03:06.94]let's save it all up for an ultimate prize
[03:09.48]homecoming gathering with a big surprise
[03:11.95]throw on your favorite record that's good to go
[03:14.42]on the analog table and it's hooked to blow
[03:16.87]sit back with ease and hear the emcee flow
[03:19.52]high hat kick drum all the highs and lows
[03:22.10]It's funny how the music put times in perspective
[03:24.77]Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
[03:28.00]Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
[03:32.31]Um, third time's the charm, hopefully
[03:34.72]when I chime on your door you'd still let me in
[03:37.21]after all these years
[03:38.63]the room that you caved in my heart is exactly the same as you left it
[03:42.56]I realize that you have moved on
[03:44.87]new styles and cliques like them silent flicks
[03:47.78]I'm speechless in this golden occasion
[03:49.95]the beautiful expression on the silver creation
[03:52.85]this time I'd like to keep in touch
[03:55.17]I'm a likkle bit wiser, a whole lot tougher
[03:57.45]if I suffer through another nightmare tonight,
[04:00.14]we'll chalk it up as another chapter to write, all right?
[04:03.49]or wrong or somewhere down the middle of the road
[04:05.81]I wanna see you again in a scene with the backdrop a perfect ten
[04:09.46]and the music can take us back to the spot right then
[04:12.57]from black and white to a sepia tone
[04:15.17]some dreams come with a tint or in monochrome
[04:17.65]from black and white to my skin tone
[04:20.18]some dreams have a stint on the microphone
[04:22.78]It's funny how the music put times in perspective
[04:25.37]Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
[04:28.58]Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
[04:32.44]Wherever you are
[04:42.76]Okay we can take it all back to the register
[04:45.49]and start all over from the canister
[04:48.26]Just break it all down into pieces of bright
[04:50.45]moments that pass by like a meteorite
[04:53.12]throw on your favorite jacket and you're good to roll
[04:55.38]on the analog trail and you look the role
[04:57.91]just stroll through the trees and let your miseries go
[05:00.47]sunshine hurricane all the highs and lows
[05:13.32]we can take it all back to the register
[05:15.81]and start all over from the canister
[05:18.34]Just break it all down into pieces of bright
[05:20.75]moments that pass by like a meteorite
