[00:00.00]Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
[00:03.29]Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
[00:06.90]Brown paper packages tied up with strings
[00:10.27]These are a few of my favorite things
[00:17.20]Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
[00:20.20]Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
[00:23.20]Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
[00:26.50]These are a few of my favorite things
[00:31.82]Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
[00:34.88]Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
[00:38.24]Silver white winters that melt into springs
[00:41.65]These are a few of my favorite things
[00:45.21]When the dog bites
[00:47.03]when the bee stings
[00:48.52]When I'm feeling sad
[00:51.75]I simply remember my favorite things
[00:54.97]And then I don't feel so bad
